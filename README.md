# Shopify-Backdoor-URL-Generator
Generates a URL for a Shopify powered site using simple post data.

You can gather the ItemID if you put a .xml behind an item url
as Example : https://kith.com/products/nike-air-force-1-low-retro-nyc-black-white.xml

Once you have typed up a URL you believe is correct, add “.xml” to the end of the URL. If you guess the URL incorrectly you will be presented a page that leads to an error, if the URL is correct it will take you to a page full of code.

Step 2: Go down through the page until you find your size. For this example, will be using my Size 10. Look carefully, with so much coding it can be hard to miss sometimes. You will need to select the size ID which will be located near < option2 > and look like “>########<“ for example.

Enjoy ;)
